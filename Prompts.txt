You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter you is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and date is the stylishness of your date's clothes. Write a method that returns your chances of getting a table, encoded as an int value with 0 = no, 1 = maybe, 2 = yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes).

The method takes two integer parameters, you and date, which represent the stylishness of your clothes and your date's clothes, respectively. The stylishness values range from 0 to 10.

The method should return an integer value representing the chances of getting a table, encoded as follows:

0 = no chance

1 = maybe

2 = yes

The rules for determining the result are as follows:

If either you or your date has a stylishness of 8 or more, the result is 2 (yes), unless:

Either you or your date has a stylishness of 2 or less, in which case the result is 0 (no).

If neither of the above conditions is met, the result is 1 (maybe).

Given three integer values, a, b, and c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a "teen" (in the range 13..19 inclusive), then that value counts as 0, except for the values 15 and 16, which do not count as teens and should be included as-is in the sum.

Requirements:

Write a method called noTeenSum(int a, int b, int c) that calculates the sum of the three integers while applying the teen rule.

Write a separate helper method called fixTeen(int n) that takes an integer value and returns the value fixed according to the teen rule. This method should be used within noTeenSum to avoid code repetition (decomposition).

Teen Rule Logic:

If the input integer n is between 13 and 19 inclusive, and it is not 15 or 16, it should be treated as 0.

Otherwise, the value of n should be returned as-is.

Method Signatures:

noTeenSum(17, 18, 19) should return 0 (all values are teens and treated as 0).

Implementation Guidelines:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java

public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Write the complete implementation for both methods.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {

}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

}?You are tasked with implementing a Java method called isEverywhere that determines if a given value is ""everywhere"" in an array. A value is considered ""everywhere"" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

The method should return true if there exists a place to split the array such that the sum of the numbers on one side of the split is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side. Otherwise, it should return false.

Problem Details:
The array nums is non-empty.

You need to determine if there is an index i (where 0 < i < nums.length) such that the sum of elements from nums[0] to nums[i-1] is equal to the sum of elements from nums[i] to nums[nums.length - 1].

If such an index exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be split at index 3 where the sum of the left side [1, 1, 1] is 3, and the sum of the right side [2, 1] is also 3.

Input: nums = [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no index where the sums of the left and right sides are equal.

Implementation:
Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean canBalance(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Constraints:
The array nums will have at least one element.

The elements in nums can be positive, negative, or zero.

Approach:
Calculate the total sum of the array.

Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the left side.

At each index, check if the running sum equals half of the total sum.

If such an index is found, return true; otherwise, return false after the loop.

Notes:
Handle edge cases, such as when the array has only one element (return false).

Given n >= 0, create an array with the pattern {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ... 1, 2, 3 .. n} (spaces added to show the grouping). Note that the length of the array will be 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n, which is known to sum to exactly n * (n + 1)/2.
public int[] seriesUp(int n)
{
    
}?You are tasked with implementing a Java method called seriesUp that generates an array following a specific pattern. Given an integer n >= 0, the array should contain the sequence {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: n = 0
Output: []

{
    
}?You are tasked with implementing a method in Java that performs a "left shift" operation on an array. The method should take an integer array as input and return a new array that is left-shifted by one position. This means that the first element of the input array should move to the end of the array, and all other elements should shift one position to the left.

For example:

If the input array is {6, 2, 5, 3}, the method should return {2, 5, 3, 6}.

If the input array is {1, 2}, the method should return {2, 1}.

If the input array is {1}, the method should return {1}.

Write the complete implementation of the shiftLeft method in Java. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array. Ensure your solution handles edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element.

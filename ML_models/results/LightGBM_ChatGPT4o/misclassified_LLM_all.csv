Given a string str, find all places where a three-letter combination starting with ""z"" and ending with ""p"" occurs. Return a string where for all such three-letter sequences, the middle letter has been removed. For example, a string like ""zipXzap"" would produce a result of ""zpXzp"".

Return the centered average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array has a length of 3 or more.

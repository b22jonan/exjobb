However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

Given a string, if the same 2-character substring appears at both its beginning and end, return the contents of the string without the 2-character substring at the beginning. For example, ""HelloHe"" yields ""lloHe"". Note that the 2-character substring at the beginning may overlap with the one at the end, so ""Hi"" yields """". If the two characters at the start and end of the string do not match each other, return the original string unchanged.

Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

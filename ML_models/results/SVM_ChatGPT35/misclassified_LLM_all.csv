However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called fizzBuzz that generates a series of numbers starting from start (inclusive) and ending at end (exclusive). For each number in this series, you need to apply the following rules:

If the number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the string """"Fizz"""".

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String[] fizzBuzz(int start, int end)
Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary."

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {

}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

The method should take an integer array as input and return a new array that is left-shifted by one position. This means that the first element of the input array should move to the end of the array, and all other elements should shift one position to the left.

For example:

If the input array is {6, 2, 5, 3}, the method should return {2, 5, 3, 6}.

If the input array is {1, 2}, the method should return {2, 1}.

If the input array is {1}, the method should return {1}.

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {

}
Constraints:

Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Constraints:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

If the number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the string """"Fizz"""".

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String[] fizzBuzz(int start, int end)
Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary."

Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, return true if every 2 that appears in the array is next to another 2. Otherwise, return false.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean twoTwo(int[] nums) {

Examples:

twoTwo([4, 2, 2, 3]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4, 2]) should return false because the last 2 is not next to another 2.

twoTwo([1, 3, 4]) should return true because there are no 2s in the array.

twoTwo([2]) should return false because the single 2 is not next to another 2.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and check if every 2 has another 2 immediately before or after it.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array, a single 2, or no 2s in the array.

Ensure the solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

Output:

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Constraints:

Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {

}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called fizzBuzz that generates a series of numbers starting from start (inclusive) and ending at end (exclusive). For each number in this series, you need to apply the following rules:

If the number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the string """"Fizz"""".

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String[] fizzBuzz(int start, int end)
Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary."

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Write the code inside the sum3 method to achieve the desired functionality."

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3

The method should take an integer array as input and return a new array that is left-shifted by one position. This means that the first element of the input array should move to the end of the array, and all other elements should shift one position to the left.

For example:

If the input array is {6, 2, 5, 3}, the method should return {2, 5, 3, 6}.

If the input array is {1, 2}, the method should return {2, 1}.

If the input array is {1}, the method should return {1}.

Write the complete implementation of the shiftLeft method in Java. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array. Ensure your solution handles edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Method Signature:

Copy
public boolean twoTwo(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Examples:

twoTwo([4, 2, 2, 3]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4, 2]) should return false because the last 2 is not next to another 2.

twoTwo([1, 3, 4]) should return true because there are no 2s in the array.

twoTwo([2]) should return false because the single 2 is not next to another 2.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and check if every 2 has another 2 immediately before or after it.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array, a single 2, or no 2s in the array.

Ensure the solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

Output:
Provide the complete Java method implementation that satisfies the problem statement and passes all the given examples."

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Constraints:

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

This means that the first element of the input array should move to the end of the array, and all other elements should shift one position to the left.

For example:

If the input array is {6, 2, 5, 3}, the method should return {2, 5, 3, 6}.

If the input array is {1, 2}, the method should return {2, 1}.

If the input array is {1}, the method should return {1}.

Write the complete implementation of the shiftLeft method in Java. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array. Ensure your solution handles edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element.

Here is the method signature to start with:

To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper public int round10(int num) and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c)
{
    
}

public int round10(int num)
{
    
}

You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter you is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and date is the stylishness of your date's clothes. Write a method that returns your chances of getting a table, encoded as an int value with 0 = no, 1 = maybe, 2 = yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

Write a function in Java that implements the following logic: You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, or 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday--on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

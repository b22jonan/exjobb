The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

The string """"yxy"""" is balanced because all 'x' characters have at least one 'y' after them.

The string """"yx"""" is balanced because the single 'x' has a 'y' after it.

The string """"xxx"""" is not balanced because there are no 'y' characters to balance the 'x's.

Write a Java method xyBalance that takes a string str as input and returns true if the string is xy-balanced, and false otherwise. The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with no 'x' or 'y' characters.

Method Signature:

Examples:

xyBalance(""""xxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xyx"""") should return false.

xyBalance(""""yxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""yx"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xxx"""") should return false.

xyBalance("""""""") should return true (an empty string is considered balanced).

xyBalance(""""abc"""") should return true (no 'x' characters means it's balanced).

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

Ensure that every 'x' has at least one 'y' that appears after it.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

Constraints:

The string can be of any length, including empty.

The string can contain any characters, not just 'x' and 'y'.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

The string """"yxy"""" is balanced because all 'x' characters have at least one 'y' after them.

The string """"yx"""" is balanced because the single 'x' has a 'y' after it.

The string """"xxx"""" is not balanced because there are no 'y' characters to balance the 'x's.

Write a Java method xyBalance that takes a string str as input and returns true if the string is xy-balanced, and false otherwise. The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with no 'x' or 'y' characters.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean xyBalance(String str) {
    // Your code here
}
Examples:

xyBalance(""""xxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xyx"""") should return false.

xyBalance(""""yxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""yx"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xxx"""") should return false.

xyBalance("""""""") should return true (an empty string is considered balanced).

xyBalance(""""abc"""") should return true (no 'x' characters means it's balanced).

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

Ensure that every 'x' has at least one 'y' that appears after it.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

Constraints:

The string can be of any length, including empty.

The string can contain any characters, not just 'x' and 'y'.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

Approach:

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

The string """"yxy"""" is balanced because all 'x' characters have at least one 'y' after them.

The string """"yx"""" is balanced because the single 'x' has a 'y' after it.

The string """"xxx"""" is not balanced because there are no 'y' characters to balance the 'x's.

Write a Java method xyBalance that takes a string str as input and returns true if the string is xy-balanced, and false otherwise. The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with no 'x' or 'y' characters.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean xyBalance(String str) {
    // Your code here
}
Examples:

xyBalance(""""xxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xyx"""") should return false.

xyBalance(""""yxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""yx"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xxx"""") should return false.

xyBalance("""""""") should return true (an empty string is considered balanced).

xyBalance(""""abc"""") should return true (no 'x' characters means it's balanced).

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

Ensure that every 'x' has at least one 'y' that appears after it.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

Constraints:

The string can be of any length, including empty.

The string can contain any characters, not just 'x' and 'y'.

Write the Java method to solve this problem."

We'll say that a string is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' characterss in the string, there exists a 'y' character somewhere later in the string. So ""xxy"" is balanced, but ""xyx"" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's. Return true if the given string is xy-balanced.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

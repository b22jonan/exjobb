For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Your Task:

Complete the following method:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Your Task:

Complete the following method:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The function should return a new string composed of n repetitions of the last n characters of the input string str. You can assume that n is always between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.

For example:

If str = ""Hello"" and n = 2, the function should return ""lolo"" because the last 2 characters are ""lo"", and it is repeated twice.

If str = ""Hello"" and n = 3, the function should return ""llollollo"" because the last 3 characters are ""llo"", and it is repeated three times.

The method should check if the input string str contains a substring that matches the pattern ""b*b"", where the middle character (represented by *) can be any single character.

For example:

bobThere(""bob"") should return true.

bobThere(""b9b"") should return true.

bobThere(""b123b"") should return false (because the middle part is more than one character).

bobThere(""hello"") should return false (because there is no ""b*b"" pattern).

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

The function signature is:

Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Instructions:

The method should check if the input string str contains a substring that matches the pattern ""b*b"", where the middle character (represented by *) can be any single character.

For example:

bobThere(""bob"") should return true.

bobThere(""b9b"") should return true.

bobThere(""b123b"") should return false (because the middle part is more than one character).

bobThere(""hello"") should return false (because there is no ""b*b"" pattern).

Ensure the method handles edge cases, such as an empty string or a string shorter than 3 characters.

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element."

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Write the complete implementation for both methods."

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0

Otherwise, if all three values are the same (but not necessarily 2), the function should return 5.

Otherwise, if both b and c are different from a, the function should return 1.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function should return 0.

Ensure the function is concise, properly structured, and adheres to Java syntax. Use conditional statements to implement the logic.

Example usage:

redTicket(2, 2, 2) should return 10.

redTicket(1, 1, 1) should return 5.

redTicket(0, 1, 2) should return 1.

redTicket(0, 0, 1) should return 0.

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element."

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called without2 that processes a given string according to the following rules:

If the same 2-character substring appears at both the beginning and the end of the string, return the contents of the string without the 2-character substring at the beginning.

Example: ""HelloHe"" yields ""lloHe"".

If the 2-character substring at the beginning overlaps with the one at the end (e.g., the string has only 2 characters), return an empty string.

Example: ""Hi"" yields """".

If the two characters at the start and end of the string do not match, return the original string unchanged.

Example: ""Hello"" yields ""Hello"".

Write the implementation for the without2 method in Java. Ensure your solution handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with fewer than 2 characters.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String without2(String str) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Examples:

without2(""HelloHe"") → ""lloHe""

without2(""Hi"") → """"

without2(""Hello"") → ""Hello""

without2("""") → """"

without2(""a"") → ""a""

Provide the complete implementation for the without2 method."

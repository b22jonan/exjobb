Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately."

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

}","You are tasked with writing a Java method called fix45 that takes an integer array nums as input and returns a new array with the following properties:

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Do not move the 4s in the array.

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

java
Copy
public int[] fix45(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Optimize your solution to ensure it runs efficiently."

Problem Statement:
Given three integer values, a, b, and c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a ""teen"" (in the range 13..19 inclusive), then that value counts as 0, except for the values 15 and 16, which do not count as teens and should be included as-is in the sum.

Requirements:

Write a method called noTeenSum(int a, int b, int c) that calculates the sum of the three integers while applying the teen rule.

Write a separate helper method called fixTeen(int n) that takes an integer value and returns the value fixed according to the teen rule. This method should be used within noTeenSum to avoid code repetition (decomposition).

Teen Rule Logic:

If the input integer n is between 13 and 19 inclusive, and it is not 15 or 16, it should be treated as 0.

Otherwise, the value of n should be returned as-is.

Method Signatures:

java
Copy
public int noTeenSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Your implementation here
}

public int fixTeen(int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Example Inputs and Outputs:

noTeenSum(1, 2, 3) should return 6 (no teens).

noTeenSum(2, 13, 1) should return 3 (13 is treated as 0).

noTeenSum(2, 15, 1) should return 18 (15 is not treated as a teen).

noTeenSum(17, 18, 19) should return 0 (all values are teens and treated as 0).

Implementation Guidelines:

Use the fixTeen method to handle the teen rule logic for each input value.

Avoid repeating the teen rule logic in the noTeenSum method by calling fixTeen for each input.

Ensure the code is clean, readable, and properly formatted.

Write the complete implementation for both methods in Java."

For example:

If str = ""Hello"" and n = 2, the function should return ""lolo"" because the last 2 characters are ""lo"", and it is repeated twice.

If str = ""Hello"" and n = 3, the function should return ""llollollo"" because the last 3 characters are ""llo"", and it is repeated three times.

Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String[] fizzBuzz(int start, int end)
Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary."

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic."

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

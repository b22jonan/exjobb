Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4.

Given an array of int values, return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. For example, with {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, the ends are the same for n == 0 and n == 2, and false for n == 1 and n == 3. You may assume that n is in the range 0..nums.length, inclusive.

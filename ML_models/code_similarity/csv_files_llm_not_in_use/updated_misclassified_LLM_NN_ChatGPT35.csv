The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

If the two characters at the start and end of the string do not match each other, return the original string unchanged.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3

Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {

Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy

}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

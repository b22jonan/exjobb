The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The method should return the correct number of clumps for any given input array.",4

Example Input and Output:

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Constraints:

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

day (an integer): Represents the day of the week, where 0 = Sun, 1 = Mon, 2 = Tue, ..., 6 = Sat.

vacation (a boolean): Indicates whether the user is on vacation (true) or not (false).

The function should return a string representing the time the alarm clock should ring based on the following rules:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday, i.e., 1 to 5), the alarm should ring at ""7:00"".

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday, i.e., 0 and 6), the alarm should ring at ""10:00"".

If the user is on vacation:

On weekdays, the alarm should ring at ""10:00"".

On weekends, the alarm should be ""off"".

Write the implementation of the alarmClock function in Java. Ensure the function handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules above.

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

Given an integer n >= 0, the array should contain the sequence {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: n = 0
Output: []

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Write the code inside the sum3 method to achieve the desired functionality.",4

The method takes two integer parameters, you and date, which represent the stylishness of your clothes and your date's clothes, respectively. The stylishness values range from 0 to 10.

The method should return an integer value representing the chances of getting a table, encoded as follows:

0 = no chance

1 = maybe

2 = yes

The rules for determining the result are as follows:

If either you or your date has a stylishness of 8 or more, the result is 2 (yes), unless:

Either you or your date has a stylishness of 2 or less, in which case the result is 0 (no).

If neither of the above conditions is met, the result is 1 (maybe).

Write the implementation of the dateFashion method in Java. Ensure the method handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules provided.

Example Method Signature:

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Requirements:
The method signature is:

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

Write a Java method xyBalance that takes a string str as input and returns true if the string is xy-balanced, and false otherwise. The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with no 'x' or 'y' characters.

Method Signature:

java
Copy

Examples:

xyBalance(""""xyx"""") should return false.

xyBalance(""""yxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""yx"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xxx"""") should return false.

xyBalance("""""""") should return true (an empty string is considered balanced).

xyBalance(""""abc"""") should return true (no 'x' characters means it's balanced).

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

Ensure that every 'x' has at least one 'y' that appears after it.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

Method Signature:

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

The function should return a string representing the time the alarm clock should ring based on the following rules:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday, i.e., 1 to 5), the alarm should ring at ""7:00"".

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday, i.e., 0 and 6), the alarm should ring at ""10:00"".

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Do not move the 4s in the array.

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

java
Copy

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

Input: {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5}

Output: {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}

Steps to implement:

Iterate through the array.

Replace all subsequent elements with this stored value until another multiple of 10 is encountered.

Repeat the process until the end of the array is reached.

Return the modified array.

Write the Java method tenRun to achieve this functionality.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or no multiples of 10.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

Given an integer n >= 0, the array should contain the sequence {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: n = 0
Output: []

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

day (an integer): Represents the day of the week, where 0 = Sun, 1 = Mon, 2 = Tue, ..., 6 = Sat.

vacation (a boolean): Indicates whether the user is on vacation (true) or not (false).

The function should return a string representing the time the alarm clock should ring based on the following rules:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday, i.e., 1 to 5), the alarm should ring at ""7:00"".

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday, i.e., 0 and 6), the alarm should ring at ""10:00"".

If the user is on vacation:

On weekdays, the alarm should ring at ""10:00"".

On weekends, the alarm should be ""off"".

Write the implementation of the alarmClock function in Java. Ensure the function handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules above.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The method should return the correct number of clumps for any given input array.",4

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // Your code here
}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

}","You are tasked with writing a Java method called fix45 that takes an integer array nums as input and returns a new array with the following properties:

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Do not move the 4s in the array.

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

java
Copy
public int[] fix45(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Optimize your solution to ensure it runs efficiently.",4

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy

    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper public int round10(int num) and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c)
{

Given an int[] array, write a function that returns an array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

However, if any of the values is a teen--in the range 13..19 inclusive--then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as teens.

Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // Your code here
}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

If the same 2-character substring appears at both the beginning and the end of the string, return the contents of the string without the 2-character substring at the beginning.

Example: ""HelloHe"" yields ""lloHe"".

If the 2-character substring at the beginning overlaps with the one at the end (e.g., the string has only 2 characters), return an empty string.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The method takes two integer parameters, you and date, which represent the stylishness of your clothes and your date's clothes, respectively. The stylishness values range from 0 to 10.

The method should return an integer value representing the chances of getting a table, encoded as follows:

0 = no chance

1 = maybe

2 = yes

The rules for determining the result are as follows:

If either you or your date has a stylishness of 8 or more, the result is 2 (yes), unless:

Either you or your date has a stylishness of 2 or less, in which case the result is 0 (no).

If neither of the above conditions is met, the result is 1 (maybe).

Write the implementation of the dateFashion method in Java. Ensure the method handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules provided.

Example Method Signature:

java
Copy
public int dateFashion(int you, int date) {
    // Your implementation here

Examples:

dateFashion(5, 10) should return 2 (yes, because the date's stylishness is 8 or more).

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

The method takes two integer parameters, you and date, which represent the stylishness of your clothes and your date's clothes, respectively. The stylishness values range from 0 to 10.

The method should return an integer value representing the chances of getting a table, encoded as follows:

0 = no chance

1 = maybe

2 = yes

The rules for determining the result are as follows:

If either you or your date has a stylishness of 8 or more, the result is 2 (yes), unless:

Either you or your date has a stylishness of 2 or less, in which case the result is 0 (no).

If neither of the above conditions is met, the result is 1 (maybe).

Write the implementation of the dateFashion method in Java. Ensure the method handles all edge cases and adheres to the rules provided.

Example Method Signature:

dateFashion(5, 10) should return 2 (yes, because the date's stylishness is 8 or more).

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Constraints:

Implementation:

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Given an int[] array, write a function that returns an array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}.

Requirements:

The method signature is:
public int[] fizzArray(int n)

Use a for loop to populate the array with the sequence of numbers.

Do not use a separate if statement to handle the case where n is 0. The for loop should naturally handle this case by executing 0 times.

Use the syntax new int[desired_length] to create the array.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy

}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The string """"xxy"""" is balanced because both 'x' characters have a 'y' after them.

The string """"xyx"""" is not balanced because the last 'x' does not have a 'y' after it.

The string """"yxy"""" is balanced because all 'x' characters have at least one 'y' after them.

The string """"yx"""" is balanced because the single 'x' has a 'y' after it.

The string """"xxx"""" is not balanced because there are no 'y' characters to balance the 'x's.

Write a Java method xyBalance that takes a string str as input and returns true if the string is xy-balanced, and false otherwise. The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with no 'x' or 'y' characters.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean xyBalance(String str) {

Examples:

xyBalance(""""xxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xyx"""") should return false.

xyBalance(""""yxy"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""yx"""") should return true.

xyBalance(""""xxx"""") should return false.

xyBalance("""""""") should return true (an empty string is considered balanced).

xyBalance(""""abc"""") should return true (no 'x' characters means it's balanced).

Approach:

Iterate through the string to find the positions of 'x' and 'y' characters.

Ensure that every 'x' has at least one 'y' that appears after it.

If no 'x' characters exist, the string is automatically balanced.

If 'x' characters exist but no 'y' characters appear after them, the string is not balanced.

Constraints:

The string can be of any length, including empty.

The string can contain any characters, not just 'x' and 'y'.

Requirements:
The method signature is:

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // Your code here
}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called countClumps that takes an integer array nums as input and returns the number of ""clumps"" in the array. A ""clump"" is defined as a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value.

Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The method should return the correct number of clumps for any given input array.",4

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called endOther that takes two strings, a and b, as input. The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The method should return the correct number of clumps for any given input array.",4

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

Iterate through the array.

Replace all subsequent elements with this stored value until another multiple of 10 is encountered.

Repeat the process until the end of the array is reached.

Return the modified array.

Write the Java method tenRun to achieve this functionality.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4, 2]) should return false because the last 2 is not next to another 2.

twoTwo([1, 3, 4]) should return true because there are no 2s in the array.

twoTwo([2]) should return false because the single 2 is not next to another 2.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and check if every 2 has another 2 immediately before or after it.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array, a single 2, or no 2s in the array.

Ensure the solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0
Output: true

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:

The method signature is:
public int[] fizzArray(int n)

Use a for loop to populate the array with the sequence of numbers.

Do not use a separate if statement to handle the case where n is 0. The for loop should naturally handle this case by executing 0 times.

Use the syntax new int[desired_length] to create the array.

Example Input and Output:

If n = 4, the method should return [0, 1, 2, 3].

If n = 0, the method should return [].

You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called endOther that takes two strings, a and b, as input. The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

Given an integer n >= 0, the array should contain the sequence {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: n = 0

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Complete the following method:

The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // Your code here
}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

}","You are tasked with writing a Java method to solve the following problem:

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). The method should return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy
public int makeChocolate(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // Your code here
}
Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) should return 4 (1 big bar + 4 small bars = 9 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Return the number of small bars needed or -1 if it's not possible.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {

Constraints:

Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

We want to make a package of exactly goal kilos of chocolate. We have two types of chocolate bars: small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each).

If it's not possible to make exactly goal kilos of chocolate using the available bars, the method should return -1.

Write the method makeChocolate with the following signature:

java
Copy

Requirements:

Use as many big bars (5 kilos) as possible before using small bars (1 kilo).

If the total weight of the big bars used exceeds the goal, reduce the number of big bars to fit the goal.

If the goal cannot be achieved with the given number of small and big bars, return -1.

The method should efficiently compute the result without unnecessary calculations.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) should return -1 (not enough bars to make 10 kilos).

makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

makeChocolate(6, 2, 7) should return 2 (1 big bar + 2 small bars = 7 kilos).

Steps to Solve:

Calculate the maximum number of big bars that can be used without exceeding the goal.

Determine the remaining weight after using the big bars.

Check if the remaining weight can be covered by the available small bars.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

The rules for determining the result are as follows:

If either you or your date has a stylishness of 8 or more, the result is 2 (yes), unless:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Repeat the process until the end of the array is reached.

Return the modified array.

Write a function in Java that implements the following logic: Given 3 int values, a, b, and c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is 13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a, b, and c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper public int round10(int num) and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().

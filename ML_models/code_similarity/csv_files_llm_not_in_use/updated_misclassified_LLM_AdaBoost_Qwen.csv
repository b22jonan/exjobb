For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a, b, and c, return the sum of their rounded values.

Given an int[] array, write a function that returns an array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}.

ecda29b5-3e42-47cb-8282-02ccd8a09b09,"### Approach Explanation:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:**","You are given a coding problem to solve. The task is to implement a method canBalance in Java that takes a non-empty array of integers nums as input. The method should return true if there exists a place to split the array such that the sum of the numbers on one side of the split is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side. Otherwise, it should return false.

Problem Details:
The array nums is non-empty.

You need to determine if there is an index i (where 0 < i < nums.length) such that the sum of elements from nums[0] to nums[i-1] is equal to the sum of elements from nums[i] to nums[nums.length - 1].

If such an index exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be split at index 3 where the sum of the left side [1, 1, 1] is 3, and the sum of the right side [2, 1] is also 3.

Input: nums = [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no index where the sums of the left and right sides are equal.

Implementation:
Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean canBalance(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Constraints:
The array nums will have at least one element.

The elements in nums can be positive, negative, or zero.

Approach:
Calculate the total sum of the array.

Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the left side.

At each index, check if the running sum equals half of the total sum.

If such an index is found, return true; otherwise, return false after the loop.

Notes:
Handle edge cases, such as when the array has only one element (return false).

Given an integer array nums, write a function withoutTen that removes all instances of the number 10 from the array. The remaining elements should shift left to fill the gaps left by the removed 10s, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be filled with 0. The function should either modify and return the input array or create and return a new array.

Example:

Input: {1, 10, 10, 2}
Output: {1, 2, 0, 0}

Input: {10, 2, 10}
Output: {2, 0, 0}

Input: {1, 99, 10}
Output: {1, 99, 0}

Requirements:

The function signature is:
public int[] withoutTen(int[] nums)

The function should handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with no 10s.

The function should efficiently process the array in a single pass if possible.

The function should preserve the order of the non-10 elements.

1. **Initialize a Pointer**: We start by initializing a pointer `insertPos` at the beginning of the array. This pointer keeps track of where the next non-10 element should be inserted.

Given an integer array nums, write a function withoutTen that removes all instances of the number 10 from the array. The remaining elements should shift left to fill the gaps left by the removed 10s, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be filled with 0. The function should either modify and return the input array or create and return a new array.

Example:

Input: {1, 10, 10, 2}
Output: {1, 2, 0, 0}

Input: {10, 2, 10}
Output: {2, 0, 0}

Input: {1, 99, 10}
Output: {1, 99, 0}

Requirements:

The function signature is:
public int[] withoutTen(int[] nums)

The function should handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with no 10s.

The function should efficiently process the array in a single pass if possible.

The function should preserve the order of the non-10 elements.

The function should fill the end of the array with 0s to maintain the original array length.

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:**","You are given a coding problem to solve. The task is to implement a method canBalance in Java that takes a non-empty array of integers nums as input. The method should return true if there exists a place to split the array such that the sum of the numbers on one side of the split is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side. Otherwise, it should return false.

Problem Details:
The array nums is non-empty.

You need to determine if there is an index i (where 0 < i < nums.length) such that the sum of elements from nums[0] to nums[i-1] is equal to the sum of elements from nums[i] to nums[nums.length - 1].

If such an index exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be split at index 3 where the sum of the left side [1, 1, 1] is 3, and the sum of the right side [2, 1] is also 3.

Input: nums = [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no index where the sums of the left and right sides are equal.

Implementation:
Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean canBalance(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Constraints:
The array nums will have at least one element.

The elements in nums can be positive, negative, or zero.

Approach:
Calculate the total sum of the array.

Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the left side.

At each index, check if the running sum equals half of the total sum.

If such an index is found, return true; otherwise, return false after the loop.

Notes:
Handle edge cases, such as when the array has only one element (return false).

Write two methods in Java that implements the following logic: Given 3 int values, a, b, and c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen--in the range 13..19 inclusive--then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as teens. Write a separate helper method called fixTeen() that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. ""decomposition"").

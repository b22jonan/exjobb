Requirements:

The method should iterate through the array and identify all clumps.

A clump is counted only once, regardless of the number of elements in the series.

The method should return the total count of clumps found in the array.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Output: 2 (There are two clumps: [2, 2] and [4, 4, 4])

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 1 (There is one clump: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 0 (There are no clumps)

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public int countClumps(int[] nums) {
    // Your code here
}
Guidelines:

Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

Consider using a loop to traverse the array and keep track of clumps as you encounter them.

Test your implementation with various inputs to ensure correctness.

Expected Output:

The method should return the correct number of clumps for any given input array.",4

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a, b, and c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper public int round10(int num) and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().

Given a string, if the same 2-character substring appears at both its beginning and end, return the contents of the string without the 2-character substring at the beginning. For example, ""HelloHe"" yields ""lloHe"". Note that the 2-character substring at the beginning may overlap with the one at the end, so ""Hi"" yields """". If the two characters at the start and end of the string do not match each other, return the original string unchanged.

We'll say that a string is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' characterss in the string, there exists a 'y' character somewhere later in the string. So ""xxy"" is balanced, but ""xyx"" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's. Return true if the given string is xy-balanced.

You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter you is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and date is the stylishness of your date's clothes. Write a method that returns your chances of getting a table, encoded as an int value with 0 = no, 1 = maybe, 2 = yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

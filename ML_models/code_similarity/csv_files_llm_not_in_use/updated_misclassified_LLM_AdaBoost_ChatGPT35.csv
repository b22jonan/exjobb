For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

Write the complete Java function zeroMax and any helper functions if needed. Ensure the code is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately.",4

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.",4

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

However, you must ignore sections of numbers that start with a 6 and extend to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). If the array is empty, return 0.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and sum all the numbers.

When you encounter a 6, ignore all subsequent numbers until you encounter a 7 (including the 6 and 7 themselves).

After encountering a 7, resume summing the numbers.

If the array is empty, return 0.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

sum67([1, 2, 2]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) should return 5.

sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) should return 4.

sum67([]) should return 0.

Your Task:
Write the Java method sum67 that fulfills the requirements above. Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as an empty array or multiple 6-7 sections.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {

Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

The method should return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring case differences. For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Instructions:

The method sum3 takes an array of integers (nums) as input. The array will always contain exactly three integers.

Your task is to write the code inside the method that calculates the sum of all three elements in the array.

Return the sum as an integer.

Example:

If the input array is [1, 2, 3], the method should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

If the input array is [5, 11, 2], the method should return 18 because 5 + 11 + 2 = 18.

Constraints:

The array nums will always have exactly three elements.

Each element in the array will be an integer.

Expected Output:

The method should return the sum of the three integers in the array.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Do not move the 4s in the array.

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

java
Copy
public int[] fix45(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Optimize your solution to ensure it runs efficiently.",4

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method called fizzBuzz that generates a series of numbers starting from start (inclusive) and ending at end (exclusive). For each number in this series, you need to apply the following rules:

If the number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the string """"Fizz"""".

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public String[] fizzBuzz(int start, int end)
Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary.",4

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy

    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

Given an integer n >= 0, the array should contain the sequence {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The length of the array will be the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.

Requirements:
The method signature is:
public int[] seriesUp(int n)

The array should follow the pattern where each group starts with 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the current group number. For example:

If n = 3, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3}.

If n = 4, the array should be {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Handle edge cases, such as when n = 0, by returning an empty array.

Steps to Implement:
Calculate the size of the array using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

Initialize an array of the calculated size.

Use nested loops or a single loop with appropriate logic to fill the array with the required pattern.

Return the resulting array.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
Input: n = 3
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 4
Output: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: n = 0
Output: []

If the number is a multiple of 5, replace it with the string """"Buzz"""".

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with the string """"FizzBuzz"""".

For all other numbers, convert them to their string representation using String.valueOf().

The method should return a String[] array containing the results of applying these rules to each number in the series.

Method Signature:

Example:

If start = 1 and end = 6, the series is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The output should be [""""1"""", """"2"""", """"Fizz"""", """"4"""", """"Buzz""""].

Constraints:

Assume start and end are valid integers where start < end.

The length of the output array should be equal to end - start.

Task:
Write the complete implementation of the fizzBuzz method in Java, ensuring it adheres to the rules and constraints provided. Include comments in your code to explain the logic where necessary.",4

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Implementation:

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Requirements:
The function signature is:

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Write the Java function evenlySpaced that implements the above logic.",4

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Write the fix45 method to solve this problem. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

Example Input and Output:

Input: [5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]
Output: [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]

Input: [4, 9, 4, 9, 5, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5]
Output: [4, 5, 4, 5, 1]

Constraints:

Do not move the 4s in the array.

You may assume the input array is valid according to the problem description.

Implementation:

Copy

Guidance for the LLM:

Start by identifying the positions of all 4s and 5s in the array.

Ensure that every 4 is followed by a 5 without moving the 4s.

Rearrange the 5s and other numbers as needed to satisfy the condition.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

Optimize your solution to ensure it runs efficiently.",4

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

The returned array must contain exactly the same numbers as the original array.

Every 4 in the array must be immediately followed by a 5. The 4s should not be moved; only other numbers (including 5s) can be rearranged.

The input array is guaranteed to contain the same number of 4s and 5s.

Every 4 in the array will always have a number after it that is not a 4 (i.e., no 4 will be the last element in the array).

The 5s can appear anywhere in the original array, including before or after 4s.

Consider edge cases, such as when 5s appear before 4s or when multiple 4s and 5s are present.

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

The function signature is:

java

}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

Copy

Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

}","You are tasked with implementing a Java method sameEnds that takes an array of integers nums and an integer n as input. The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

java
Copy
public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3
Output: false

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, n = 3
Output: true

Input: nums = {1, 2, 3}, n = 0
Output: true

Input: nums = {}, n = 0

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a, b, and c, return the sum of their rounded values.

For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

}","You are an expert Java programmer. Your task is to write a function in Java that implements the following logic:

The function should return a modified version of the given integer array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array.

If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.

You may use a second helper function if needed, such as to find the largest odd value to the right of a specified position.

The function signature is:

java
Copy
public int[] zeroMax(int[] nums) {
    // Your implementation here
}
Steps to follow:

Iterate through the input array nums.

For each zero encountered, find the largest odd value to the right of its position.

Replace the zero with the largest odd value found. If no odd value exists to the right, leave the zero unchanged.

Return the modified array.

Hint: You can create a helper function to find the largest odd value to the right of a given index. For example:

java
Copy
private int findLargestOddToRight(int[] nums, int startIndex) {
    // Helper function implementation
}
Example Input and Output:

Input: [0, 5, 0, 3]
Output: [5, 5, 3, 3]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 5 (the largest odd to its right), and the second zero is replaced by 3.

Input: [0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 4, 2, 2]
Explanation: The first zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right, and the second zero is replaced by 2.

Input: [0, 1, 0]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: The first zero is replaced by 1, and the second zero remains 0 because there is no odd value to its right.

Constraints:

The input array nums can have a length of 0 to 100.

The values in the array are integers between 0 and 100.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

The function should return true if the three values are evenly spaced, meaning the difference between the smallest and middle value is the same as the difference between the middle and largest value. Otherwise, it should return false.

Requirements:
The function signature is:
public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c)

The function should handle any three integers as input.

The logic should correctly identify the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

The function should return true if the values are evenly spaced, and false otherwise.

Example Inputs and Outputs:
evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6).

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) should return true because the values are evenly spaced (2, 4, 6) regardless of input order.

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) should return false because the values are not evenly spaced (3, 4, 6).

Steps to Implement:
Determine the smallest, middle, and largest values among the three inputs.

Calculate the difference between the smallest and middle values.

Calculate the difference between the middle and largest values.

Compare the two differences. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

Constraints:

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.

Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The method should check if the input string str contains a substring that matches the pattern ""b*b"", where the middle character (represented by *) can be any single character.

For example:

bobThere(""bob"") should return true.

bobThere(""b9b"") should return true.

bobThere(""b123b"") should return false (because the middle part is more than one character).

bobThere(""hello"") should return false (because there is no ""b*b"" pattern).

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a, b, and c, return the sum of their rounded values.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

A value is considered """"everywhere"""" if, for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the elements in the pair is equal to the given value.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Instructions:

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

Constraints:

Implementation:

Instructions:

Example Input and Output:

twoTwo([4, 2, 2, 3]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4]) should return true because the two 2s are adjacent.

twoTwo([2, 2, 4, 2]) should return false because the last 2 is not next to another 2.

twoTwo([1, 3, 4]) should return true because there are no 2s in the array.

twoTwo([2]) should return false because the single 2 is not next to another 2.

Requirements:

Iterate through the array and check if every 2 has another 2 immediately before or after it.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array, a single 2, or no 2s in the array.

Ensure the solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

}","You are tasked with writing a Java method to solve the following problem:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

For example, ""Hiabc"" and ""abc"" should return true, as should ""AbC"" and ""HiaBc"". The computation should not be case-sensitive, and you can use str.toLowerCase() to handle case differences.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 3, the method should return false because the first 3 elements {5, 6, 45} are not the same as the last 3 elements {99, 13, 5}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Method Signature:

public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums, int n) {

Constraints:

The array nums can have any length, including zero.

The integer n is always in the range 0 <= n <= nums.length.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 2
Output: true

Input: nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, n = 3

The method should return true if the group of n numbers at the start of the array is the same as the group of n numbers at the end of the array. Otherwise, it should return false.

For example:

For the input nums = {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6} and n = 2, the method should return true because the first 2 elements {5, 6} are the same as the last 2 elements {5, 6}.

Assume that n is always in the range 0 to nums.length, inclusive. If n is 0, the method should return true because an empty group is trivially the same at the start and end.

Write the implementation of the sameEnds method in Java. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.

Constraints:

Write the method isEverywhere that takes two parameters:

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

Write the complete implementation of the endOther method. Ensure that your solution is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.

Example Input/Output:

endOther(""Hiabc"", ""abc"") → true

endOther(""AbC"", ""HiaBc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabc"") → true

endOther(""abc"", ""abXabcd"") → false

Constraints:

The method should be case-insensitive.

The method should handle empty strings.

The method should not use any external libraries or complex data structures.

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {

}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

An integer array nums.

An integer val.

The method should return true if the value val is everywhere in the array nums, and false otherwise.

Example Input and Output:

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) should return true because every pair of adjacent elements contains at least one 1:

Pair (1, 2): contains 1.

Pair (2, 1): contains 1.

Pair (1, 3): contains 1.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) should return false because not every pair of adjacent elements contains a 2:

Pair (1, 2): contains 2.

Pair (2, 1): does not contain 2.

Pair (1, 3): does not contain 2.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) should return false because the pair (3, 4) does not contain 1.

Constraints:

The array nums may be empty or contain up to 100 elements.

The value val can be any integer.

Implementation:

Complete the following method:

java
Copy
public boolean isEverywhere(int[] nums, int val) {
    // Your code here
}
Instructions:

Iterate through the array and check every pair of adjacent elements.

If any pair does not contain the value val, return false.

If all pairs contain the value val, return true.

Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with only one element.",4

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Write the complete implementation for both methods.",4

}","You are tasked with writing a Java method to solve the following problem:

We need to round an integer value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more. For example, 15 rounds up to 20. Conversely, if the rightmost digit is less than 5, we round down to the previous multiple of 10. For example, 12 rounds down to 10.

Given three integers, a, b, and c, write a method roundSum(int a, int b, int c) that returns the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper method round10(int num) that performs the rounding logic. Call this helper method three times within roundSum to round each of the three integers.

The helper method round10 should be written entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum.

Here is the skeleton code:

java
Copy
public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Call round10 for each input and return the sum of the rounded values.
}

public int round10(int num) {
    // Implement the rounding logic here.
}
Instructions:

Implement the round10 method to round a single integer according to the rules described above.

Use the round10 method inside roundSum to round each of the three integers (a, b, and c).

Return the sum of the rounded values in roundSum.

Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and avoids repetition.

Example:

If a = 15, b = 12, and c = 8, then:

round10(15) should return 20.

round10(12) should return 10.

round10(8) should return 10.

The final result of roundSum(15, 12, 8) should be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

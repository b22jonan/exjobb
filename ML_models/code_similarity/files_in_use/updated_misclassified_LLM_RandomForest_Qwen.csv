Given an int[] array, write a function that returns an array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

Write a function in Java that implements the following logic: You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, or 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday--on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

Return the centered average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array has a length of 3 or more.

Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

Given an int[] array, write a function that returns an array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be set to 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.

Given an array, return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the original array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array. (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)

You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter you is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and date is the stylishness of your date's clothes. Write a method that returns your chances of getting a table, encoded as an int value with 0 = no, 1 = maybe, 2 = yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10. So {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5} yields {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}.

Write a function in Java that implements the following logic: You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, or 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0.
